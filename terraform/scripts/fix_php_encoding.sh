# --- Notes --- #
# ‚úÖ Purpose:
#   This script ensures that all PHP files are cleanly encoded in UTF-8 and free of BOM (Byte Order Mark),
#   which can cause unexpected issues in web applications, especially with headers and WordPress themes/plugins.
#
# ‚öôÔ∏è What it does:
#   - Scans the current directory recursively for *.php files
#   - Detects and removes BOM if present at the beginning of a file
#   - Re-encodes files to UTF-8 using iconv to ensure proper formatting
#
# üí° When to use:
#   - After cloning or modifying WordPress/PHP files from external sources
#   - Before uploading PHP files to the server
#   - When encountering "headers already sent" or invisible character issues in WordPress
#
# üõ†Ô∏è Requirements:
#   - Unix-like environment with `file`, `grep`, `sed`, and `iconv` installed
#
# ‚ùó Caution:
#   - Backup your files before running this script in production environments
#   - Not suitable for binary or non-UTF-8 encoded source files outside of PHP
