# --- Notes --- #
# This healthcheck file is used by the ALB (Application Load Balancer)
# to determine if the EC2 instance is healthy.
#
# What it checks:
#   - PHP engine status
#   - MySQL database connectivity using DB_* constants from wp-config.php (with SSL)
#   - Redis connectivity using WP_REDIS_* constants
#   - WordPress REST API availability via localhost
#
# Security & Independence:
#   - Does NOT rely on environment variables during runtime
#   - wp-config.php is the only source of secrets (DB, Redis)
#   - Environment variables from /etc/environment can be cleaned up, but keeping them is useful for manual debugging
#   - File permissions are set to 644 (owner read/write), allowing access from 'ubuntu' user if needed
#
# Best Practices:
#   - Use centralized configuration (wp-config.php) instead of exporting secrets
#   - Retrieve credentials securely via AWS Secrets Manager + wp-config.php generation
#   - Maintain consistent wp-config.php across EC2s if using Auto Scaling
#
# Compatibility:
#   - Requires PHP â‰¥ 8.3 with mysqli and redis extensions
#   - Supports MySQL (with require_secure_transport=ON)
#   - Redis must be accessible over TCP
#   - Redis password should be defined via WP_REDIS_PASSWORD (if needed)
#
# Other:
#   - REST API check may fail if WordPress is not fully installed yet
#   - This script is intended to be used *after* WordPress deployment
#
# Deployment:
#   - This script is not executed locally during provisioning.
#   - It is uploaded to the S3 "scripts" bucket and downloaded during EC2 provisioning via user-data script.
#   - Ensure the object exists at the specified S3 path before instance launch.
