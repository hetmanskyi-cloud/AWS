# --- Notes --- #
# 1. Log Groups:
#    - Logs are collected from EC2, Nginx, PHP-FPM, and WordPress runtime
#    - Each group uses CMK encryption (via KMS module)
#    - Retention can be adjusted per environment via terraform.tfvars
#
# 2. Metric Filters:
#    - Custom patterns detect Nginx 5xx and PHP fatal errors
#    - Metrics are created per pattern and published to custom namespaces
#
# 3. Alarms:
#    - Alarms send notifications via SNS (configured separately)
#    - Thresholds can be fine-tuned per environment or workload
#
# 4. Control Flags:
#    - Use `enable_cloudwatch_logs = true` in terraform.tfvars to enable
#    - Set `cw_logs_retention_in_days` to control log lifecycle
#
# 5. Best Practices:
#    - All logs are centralized for easier monitoring and debugging
#    - Use alarms in combination with Auto Scaling health checks
#
# 6. Encryption and Cleanup:
#    - All log groups are encrypted using Customer Managed KMS Key (CMK)
#    - `skip_destroy = false` allows safe cleanup during `terraform destroy` in non-prod
#
# 7. Integration with Other Modules:
#    - Alarms and logs work in tandem with ASG, ALB, and RDS monitoring configurations
#    - ALB logs are captured via access logs to S3 (enabled in the ALB module)
#    - RDS exports `error` and `slowquery` logs to CloudWatch
#    - VPC Flow Logs are configured in the VPC module and monitored for delivery issues
#
# 8. Design Justification:
#    - This CloudWatch configuration includes the **minimum required log groups and alarms** for WordPress on EC2 to ensure visibility, debuggability, and security.
#    - We intentionally excluded overly verbose log groups (e.g., all `/var/log/*`) to reduce cost and noise.
#
#    - Log groups:
#      - `/aws/ec2/user-data`: Captures provisioning logs (critical during initial setup)
#      - `/aws/ec2/system`: Captures OS-level logs for debugging and SSH access issues
#      - `/aws/ec2/nginx`: Monitors web server access and error logs
#      - `/aws/ec2/php-fpm`: Helps detect PHP-level issues
#      - `/aws/ec2/wordpress`: Application-specific logs (must be enabled via `wp-config.php`)
#
#    - Metric filters and alarms:
#      - Focused only on 5xx errors (from Nginx) and PHP Fatal Errors â€” two key signals of application failure.
#      - These are directly actionable and correlated with actual user-facing errors.
#      - Other types of application metrics (e.g., high traffic, slow responses) are already handled in the **ALB module** via access logs and CloudWatch metrics.
#    - Although we already have an ALB 5xx alarm (`HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count` in the ALB module),
#      we also monitor 5xx responses directly from Nginx logs via metric filter:
#        - **ALB 5xx** provides high-level infrastructure monitoring for ASG targets.
#        - **Nginx 5xx** provides application-layer details (URL, IP, exact code) directly from access logs.
#        - Together, they create a **multi-layered alerting system** for faster diagnosis and deeper visibility.
#
#    - ALB access logs are already enabled in the ALB module and exported to S3 for further analysis.
#    - Additional metrics for infrastructure and backend (e.g., RDS, Redis, ASG, VPC Flow Logs) are covered in their respective modules to avoid duplication and maintain modularity.
#
#    - This configuration provides:
#      - **Sufficient visibility** to troubleshoot most WordPress issues.
#      - **Low operational cost** for development and staging environments.
#      - **Scalable structure**, where deeper monitoring can be added per module if needed.
#      - **Modularity**, ensuring each module owns its own metrics and alarms cleanly.
