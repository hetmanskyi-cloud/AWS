# --- Notes --- #
# - This module enables centralized logging for EC2 instances running WordPress.
# - Each log group is encrypted using a KMS CMK (Customer Managed Key) from the KMS module.
# - Logging can be toggled using `enable_cloudwatch_logs = true` in terraform.tfvars.
# - All log groups are configured with retention to reduce cost in non-prod environments.
# - Alarms send notifications to an SNS topic (cloudwatch_alarms) configured elsewhere.
# - WordPress logs require WP_DEBUG and custom log redirection to /var/log/wordpress.log.
# - For production, adjust `retention_in_days` as needed and fine-tune alarm thresholds.
