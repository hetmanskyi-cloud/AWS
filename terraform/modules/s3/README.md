# S3 Module for Terraform

This module creates and manages S3 buckets for various use cases within a project. It includes configurations for encryption, logging, versioning, lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and access control to ensure security and compliance with best practices.

---

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Provider Configuration**:
The region and other parameters of the `aws` provider are specified in the `providers.tf` file of the root block.

An example of the configuration can be found in the "Usage Example" section.

---

## Features

- **Creates Six S3 Buckets Dynamically**:
  - Terraform state storage.
  - WordPress scripts storage.
  - Logging bucket.
  - AMI storage bucket for golden images.
  - WordPress media storage (in stage and prod environments).
  - Replication bucket (optional, in stage and prod environments for cross-region replication).
- **Dynamic Bucket Creation**:
  - The `buckets` variable dynamically determines which buckets are created and their configurations.
  - The `type` attribute defines whether the bucket is a `base` bucket (always created) or a `special` bucket (environment-specific).
  - The logic is centralized in `terraform.tfvars` for easier management.
  - Each entry in the buckets variable specifies:
    - name: The unique name of the bucket.
    - type: The classification of the bucket:
  - Base buckets: Standard buckets created in all environments.
  - Special buckets: Created only in specific environments (stage, prod).
- **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**:
  - Encryption using AWS KMS for all buckets.
  - Enforced upload encryption to deny unencrypted object uploads.
- **Public Access Control**:
  - Public access is disabled for all buckets by default.
  - Bucket policies enforce HTTPS-only access.
- **Bucket Logging**:
  - Logging enabled for all buckets, with logs stored in a dedicated logging bucket.
- **Versioning**:
  - Versioning enabled to allow recovery of overwritten or deleted objects.
- **Lifecycle Policies**:
  - Automatic cleanup of incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days.
  - Retention of noncurrent object versions for a configurable number of days.
- **CORS Configuration**:
  - Configures CORS rules for the WordPress media bucket to allow cross-origin access.
- **Cross-Region Replication** (Optional):
  - Replicates specified buckets to a destination bucket in a different AWS region for disaster recovery.
- **DynamoDB for Terraform Locking**:
  - A DynamoDB table is created for state file locking, ensuring no concurrent modifications.
- **Lambda for TTL Automation**:
  - An AWS Lambda function updates expiration timestamps for DynamoDB locks to avoid stale entries.

## Usage Example

```hcl
# Root Configuration for Providers
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1" # AWS region defined in the root configuration
}

module "s3" {
  source                            = "./modules/s3"
  environment                       = "dev"
  name_prefix                       = "dev"
  aws_account_id                    = "123456789012"
  kms_key_arn                       = "arn:aws:kms:region:123456789012:key/example-key-id"
  sns_topic_arn                     = "arn:aws:sns:region:123456789012:cloudwatch-alarms"
  noncurrent_version_retention_days = 30
  enable_s3_replication             = true
  replication_region                = "us-east-1"
  buckets = [
    { name = "terraform_state", type = "base" },
    { name = "logging", type = "base" },
    { name = "wordpress_media", type = "special" },
    { name = "replication", type = "special" }
  ]
}

output "replication_bucket" {
  value = module.s3.replication_bucket_arn
}

---

## Environment-Specific Logic
# dev:
Only base buckets are created (e.g., terraform_state, logging).
Special buckets (e.g., wordpress_media, replication) are not created.
# stage:
Both base and special buckets are created.
Cross-region replication can be enabled if enable_s3_replication is true.
# prod:
Same as stage, but with full-scale replication and additional production-grade configurations.

## Security Best Practices

**Public Access**:  
- Public access is disabled by default for all buckets.  
- Bucket policies enforce HTTPS-only access to prevent insecure connections.

**Encryption**:  
- Server-side encryption (SSE) with KMS ensures all data is encrypted at rest.  
- Policies enforce encryption during uploads, rejecting unencrypted objects to maintain compliance.

**Logging**:  
- Logging is enabled for all buckets except the logging bucket itself (to avoid recursive logging).  
- Logs are stored in a centralized logging bucket for monitoring and auditing.  
- Regularly monitor the logging bucket for unusual activity.

**Notifications**:  
- Sends notifications to an SNS topic when objects are created or deleted.  
- These notifications can be integrated with CloudWatch for enhanced monitoring and alerting.

**Versioning**:  
- Versioning is enabled for all buckets in stage and prod environments, ensuring data recovery for overwritten or deleted objects.  
- In dev, versioning is disabled to reduce costs.

**DynamoDB**:  
- The DynamoDB table used for Terraform locking is encrypted with a KMS key.  
- Point-in-time recovery (PITR) is enabled for disaster recovery.  
- A Lambda function automatically updates expiration timestamps for locks to prevent stale entries.

### Notes

** Buckets Configuration Examples:

The buckets variable is a flexible configuration option that allows defining the S3 buckets to be created. Below are examples of typical configurations for different environments:

In dev, only base buckets are created to simplify testing.
In stage and prod, additional special-purpose buckets, such as wordpress_media and replication, are included.

# Example for dev:
buckets = [
  { name = "terraform_state", type = "base" },
  { name = "scripts", type = "base" },
  { name = "logging", type = "base" },
  { name = "ami", type = "base" }
]

# Example for stage or prod:
buckets = [
  { name = "terraform_state", type = "base" },
  { name = "scripts", type = "base" },
  { name = "logging", type = "base" },
  { name = "ami", type = "base" },
  { name = "wordpress_media", type = "special" },
  { name = "replication", type = "special" } # If enable_s3_replication = true
]

**Cross-Region Replication
- Primary Region: The primary AWS region is specified in the providers.tf file of the main block.
- Replication Region: The replication_region variable specifies the destination region for replication.
- Enabling Replication: Replication is enabled only when enable_s3_replication = true.
- Destination Bucket: The destination bucket is automatically created in the specified replication_region.
- Security: Source and destination buckets are secured with IAM policies to enforce replication permissions.  

**CORS Rules**:  
- Configured only for the WordPress media bucket in stage and prod environments.  
- Allows restricted cross-origin access for WordPress media if required.

**Logging**:  
- The logging bucket itself does not have logging enabled to avoid circular dependencies.  
- The logging bucket centralizes logging for ALB, WAF, other S3 buckets, and various AWS resources in their respective folders.  
- Logging paths are dynamically organized with prefixes based on the source (e.g., `${var.name_prefix}/alb-logs/`, `${var.name_prefix}/waf-logs/`).

### Future Improvements

1. Expand lifecycle policies to include archival storage using Glacier for cost optimization.  
2. Integrate bucket logging analysis tools for improved security auditing and anomaly detection.  
3. Add support for additional use cases, such as real-time object monitoring via Lambda.  
4. Enhance modularity by allowing conditional creation of DynamoDB and Lambda resources.

## Alternative State Locking with S3 Conditional Writes

Starting from Terraform 1.10.0 and newer, you can utilize the new S3 Conditional Writes feature for state locking. This eliminates the need for DynamoDB as a locking mechanism. Instead, Terraform uses an `.tflock` file in the S3 bucket, along with Amazon S3's conditional write functionality, to ensure safe state locking.

### Key Benefits:
1. **Simpler Configuration**:
   - No additional DynamoDB table required.
   - Leverages native S3 functionality.

2. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - Eliminates DynamoDB costs for state locking.

3. **Backward Compatible**:
   - Can coexist with the existing DynamoDB-based locking mechanism if needed.

---

### Example Configuration

Below is an example configuration for using S3 Conditional Writes for state locking:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "path/to/my/state/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-1"
    use_lockfile = true
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}

---

**Notes**:

Migration: If you are currently using DynamoDB for state locking, this feature allows for a seamless transition to a simpler setup.

Compatibility: Ensure that your AWS provider version and Terraform version meet the requirements for S3 Conditional Writes.

Coexistence: You can enable this feature in one environment (e.g., dev) while maintaining DynamoDB locking in others (e.g., stage, prod).

Best Practices: For sensitive environments, continue using versioning and server-side encryption for added security.
