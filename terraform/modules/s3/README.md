# S3 Module for Terraform

This module creates and manages S3 buckets for various use cases within a project. It includes configurations for encryption, logging, versioning, lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and access control to ensure security and compliance with best practices.

---

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Provider Configuration**:  
  The `aws` provider configuration, including the region and credentials, must be set in the root block of the Terraform project. Refer to the usage example for details.
- **KMS Key**:  
  Ensure that a KMS key ARN is provided via the `kms_key_arn` variable.  
  *Note*: If the key is managed in a separate module or manually created, consider using `data "aws_kms_key"` for explicit validation of its existence. This approach is especially recommended in production environments for added reliability.

## Features

- **S3 Bucket Management**:
  - **Base buckets**: Always created (e.g., scripts, logging, ami).
  - **Special buckets**: Created conditionally based on `terraform.tfvars` (e.g., terraform_state, wordpress_media, replication).
  - Fully configurable via the `buckets` variable.

- **Lifecycle Management**:
  - Object versioning enabled to protect against accidental overwrites or deletions.
  - Noncurrent object versions are automatically deleted after a defined retention period (default: 30 days).
  - Incomplete multipart uploads are automatically aborted after 7 days to prevent unnecessary storage costs.

- **Conditional Resource Creation**:
  - **DynamoDB Table**: Created only if `enable_dynamodb = true`.
  - **AWS Lambda Function**: Created only if `enable_lambda = true`.

- **Encryption and Security**:
  - Server-Side Encryption (SSE) with AWS KMS.
  - Policies enforcing encryption for all uploaded objects.
  - HTTPS-only access enforced via bucket policies.
  - Public access disabled by default.

- **Logging and Monitoring**:
  - Logging enabled for all buckets, stored in a dedicated logging bucket.
  - Notifications for object creation and deletion integrated with SNS.
  - CloudWatch Logs provide insights into Lambda execution and failures.
  - Configurable log retention for Lambda using the `lambda_log_retention_days` variable.

- **Cross-Region Replication**:
  - Enabled via `enable_s3_replication` and `buckets` variables in `terraform.tfvars` (`replication` bucket)
  - Supports disaster recovery by replicating data to another AWS region.

- **DynamoDB Locking and TTL Automation**:
  - Ensures Terraform state file locking using DynamoDB to prevent concurrent operations.
  - The table features:
    - **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Automatically deletes expired locks.
    - **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Allows recovery to any point in the past 35 days.
    - **Stream Configuration**: Enables integration with AWS Lambda for real-time processing.
  - The AWS Lambda function automatically processes DynamoDB Streams to manage TTL updates.
  - Failed events are captured in an SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for further analysis.

- **Timeout and Error Handling**:
  - Configurable timeouts for Lambda function creation, update, and deletion to prevent long-running operations.
  - SQS DLQ stores failed Lambda events, allowing investigation and resolution of issues.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Ensure `update_ttl.zip` is up-to-date in the `scripts` directory before deployment.
  - Regularly review and update Lambda logic to align with schema changes.
  - Monitor CloudWatch logs and SQS DLQ messages to optimize performance and detect issues.
  - Run `terraform apply` to create necessary resources before enabling the remote backend.
  - Use the least privilege principle for IAM roles and policies to enhance security.

## Security Best Practices

- **Public Access**:
  - Disabled by default for all buckets.
  - HTTPS-only access enforced.

- **Encryption**:
  - Server-Side Encryption (SSE) with AWS KMS for all buckets.
  - Policies enforce encryption during uploads.
  - Consider using `data "aws_kms_key"` to validate KMS key existence if keys are managed externally.

- **Logging**:
  - Centralized in a dedicated logging bucket.
  - Regularly review and monitor logs for security.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add data "aws_kms_key" to validate the existence of the provided KMS key for improved reliability in distributed environments.
- Expand lifecycle policies to include archival storage using Glacier for cost optimization.
- Integrate bucket logging analysis tools for improved security auditing and anomaly detection.
- Consider implementing log compression using AWS Lambda for S3 bucket logs to reduce storage costs and optimize data handling, in combination with lifecycle policies for archival management.

## Alternative State Locking with S3 Conditional Writes

Starting from Terraform 1.10.0, you can use S3 Conditional Writes for state locking, removing the need for DynamoDB.

### Key Benefits:
1. **Simpler Setup**: No need for additional DynamoDB tables.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces costs by leveraging S3 features.
3. **Compatibility**: Backward compatible with existing DynamoDB locking.

---

### Example Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "path/to/my/state/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-1"
    use_lockfile = true
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}
```
