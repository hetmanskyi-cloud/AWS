# S3 Module for Terraform

This module creates and manages S3 buckets for various use cases within a project. It also includes configurations for encryption, logging, versioning, lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and access control to ensure security and compliance with best practices.

---

## Features

- **Creates Five S3 Buckets**:
  - Terraform state storage.
  - WordPress media storage.
  - WordPress scripts storage.
  - Logging bucket.
  - Replication bucket (optional, for cross-region replication).
- **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**:
  - Encryption using AWS KMS for all buckets.
  - Enforced upload encryption to deny unencrypted object uploads.
- **Public Access Control**:
  - Public access is disabled for all buckets by default.
  - Bucket policies enforce HTTPS-only access.
- **Bucket Logging**:
  - Logging enabled for all buckets, with logs stored in a dedicated logging bucket.
- **Versioning**:
  - Versioning enabled to allow recovery of overwritten or deleted objects.
- **Lifecycle Policies**:
  - Automatic cleanup of incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days.
  - Retention of noncurrent object versions for 90 days (default).
- **CORS Configuration**:
  - Configures CORS rules for the WordPress media bucket to allow cross-origin access.
- **DynamoDB Integration**:
  - DynamoDB table for Terraform state locking with KMS encryption and point-in-time recovery.
- **S3 Bucket Notifications**:
  - Sends notifications to an SNS topic for object creation and deletion events in all buckets.
- **Cross-Region Replication** (Optional):
  - Replicates specified buckets to a destination bucket in a different AWS region for disaster recovery.

## Usage Example

```hcl
module "s3" {
  source                            = "./modules/s3"
  environment                       = "dev"
  name_prefix                       = "dev"
  aws_account_id                    = "123456789012"
  kms_key_arn                       = "arn:aws:kms:region:123456789012:key/example-key-id"
  sns_topic_arn                     = "arn:aws:sns:region:123456789012:cloudwatch-alarms"
  noncurrent_version_retention_days = 90
  enable_s3_replication             = true
  replication_region                = "us-east-1"
}

output "replication_bucket" {
  value = module.s3.replication_bucket_arn
}

## Security Best Practices

Public Access:

Public access is disabled by default for all buckets.  
Bucket policies enforce HTTPS-only access.

Encryption:

Server-side encryption (SSE) with KMS ensures all data is encrypted at rest.  
Policies enforce encryption for uploads, rejecting unencrypted objects.

Logging:

Logging is enabled for all buckets.  
Logs are stored in a dedicated logging bucket for centralized monitoring.  
Ensure the logging bucket is monitored for unusual activity.

Notifications:

Sends notifications to an SNS topic when objects are created or deleted.  
Notifications are integrated with CloudWatch for monitoring.

Versioning:

Versioning is enabled for all buckets.  
Helps recover overwritten or deleted objects.

DynamoDB:

The DynamoDB table for Terraform locking is encrypted with a KMS key.  
Point-in-time recovery is enabled for disaster recovery.

---

### Notes

Cross-Region Replication:
Replication is enabled only when enable_s3_replication = true.
Destination bucket is automatically created in the specified replication_region.  
CORS Rules:
Configured only for the WordPress media bucket to allow cross-origin access when needed.  
Logging:
The logging bucket itself does not have logging enabled to avoid circular dependencies.

### Future Improvements

Expand lifecycle policies to include archival storage with Glacier.
Integrate bucket logging analysis for better security auditing.
