# S3 Module for Terraform

This module creates and manages S3 buckets for various use cases within a project. It includes configurations for encryption, logging, versioning, lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and access control to ensure security and compliance with best practices.

---

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Provider Configuration**:  
  The `aws` provider configuration, including the region and credentials, must be set in the root block of the Terraform project. Refer to the usage example for details.
- **KMS Key**:  
  Ensure that a KMS key ARN is provided via the `kms_key_arn` variable.  
  *Note*: If the key is managed in a separate module or manually created, consider using `data "aws_kms_key"` for explicit validation of its existence. This approach is especially recommended in production environments for added reliability.

---

## Features

- **S3 Bucket Management**:
  - **Base buckets**: Always created (e.g., scripts, logging, ami).
  - **Special buckets**: Created conditionally based on `terraform.tfvars` (e.g., terraform_state, wordpress_media, replication).
  - Fully configurable via the `buckets` variable.

- **Conditional Resource Creation**:
  - **DynamoDB Table**: Created only if `enable_dynamodb = true`.
  - **AWS Lambda Function**: Created only if `enable_lambda = true`.

- **Encryption and Security**:
  - Server-Side Encryption (SSE) with AWS KMS.
  - Policies enforcing encryption for all uploaded objects.
  - HTTPS-only access enforced via bucket policies.
  - Public access disabled by default.

- **Logging and Monitoring**:
  - Logging enabled for all buckets, stored in a dedicated logging bucket.
  - Notifications for object creation and deletion integrated with SNS.

- **Versioning and Lifecycle Policies**:
  - Versioning enabled to protect against accidental overwrites or deletions.
  - Automatic cleanup of incomplete multipart uploads and old versions.

- **Cross-Region Replication**:
  - Enabled via `enable_s3_replication` and `enable_replication_bucket`.
  - Supports disaster recovery by replicating data to another AWS region.

- **DynamoDB Locking**:
  - DynamoDB table for Terraform state file locking.
  - TTL automation with AWS Lambda to prevent stale locks.

- **KMS Role for S3**:
  - Conditional creation of an IAM role and policy for S3 to access KMS.
  - The role can be enabled with `enable_kms_s3_role` and integrates seamlessly with the specified `kms_key_arn`.

## Environment-Specific Logic

- **Development (dev)**:
  - Base buckets (e.g., scripts, logging, ami) are created by default.
  - Special buckets (e.g., terraform_state, replication) are created only if explicitly enabled.
  - DynamoDB and Lambda are created only if `enable_dynamodb` and `enable_lambda` are `true`.

- **Staging (stage)**:
  - Includes both base and special buckets, with optional cross-region replication.
  - DynamoDB and Lambda can be enabled for enhanced functionality.

- **Production (prod)**:
  - Similar to staging but typically with full-scale replication and stricter security policies.

---

## Security Best Practices

- **Public Access**:
  - Disabled by default for all buckets.
  - HTTPS-only access enforced.

- **Encryption**:
  - Server-Side Encryption (SSE) with AWS KMS for all buckets.
  - Policies enforce encryption during uploads.
  - Consider using `data "aws_kms_key"` to validate KMS key existence if keys are managed externally.

- **Logging**:
  - Centralized in a dedicated logging bucket.
  - Regularly review and monitor logs for security.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add dynamic KMS key lookup using `data "aws_kms_key"` for more robust validation in distributed environments.
- Expand lifecycle policies to include archival storage using Glacier for cost optimization.
- Integrate bucket logging analysis tools for improved security auditing and anomaly detection.
- Add CloudWatch Alarms for monitoring:
  - Lambda execution errors.
  - DynamoDB throughput limits.

## Alternative State Locking with S3 Conditional Writes

Starting from Terraform 1.10.0, you can use S3 Conditional Writes for state locking, removing the need for DynamoDB.

### Key Benefits:
1. **Simpler Setup**: No need for additional DynamoDB tables.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces costs by leveraging S3 features.
3. **Compatibility**: Backward compatible with existing DynamoDB locking.

---

### Example Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "path/to/my/state/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-1"
    use_lockfile = true
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}
