# --- Notes --- #
# - In production, enable HTTPS listener, WAF, and logging for improved security and observability.
# - Features controlled by `enable_*` variables (e.g., enable_waf, enable_firehose, enable_high_request_alarm)
#   are optional but highly recommended for production environments:
#     - enable_waf: Protects against common web attacks.
#     - enable_firehose: Enables detailed WAF logging to S3 for auditing.
#     - enable_*_alarm: Activates CloudWatch alarms for traffic monitoring and issue detection.
# - In development or test environments, these features can be disabled to reduce costs.
# - Validate all required ARNs (certificate_arn, sns_topic_arn, kms_key_arn) before enabling related features.
# - Regularly review and adjust alarm thresholds based on real traffic patterns and system behavior.
