# --- Notes --- #
# 1. Conditional Ingress Logic:
#    - This security group implements dynamic ingress rules controlled by the 'alb_access_cloudfront_mode' variable.
#    - This provides flexibility to run the ALB in two distinct modes, suitable for different environments.
#
# 2. Access Modes:
#    - 'alb_access_cloudfront_mode = false' (Open Mode): Allows public ingress traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
#      This mode is suitable for development or testing environments where direct access to the ALB is required.
#    - 'alb_access_cloudfront_mode = true' (CloudFront Mode): The recommended setting for production. It restricts
#      all ingress traffic to only the IPs listed in the AWS Managed Prefix List for CloudFront. This ensures
#      that no traffic can bypass the CloudFront distribution and hit the ALB directly.
#
# 3. AWS Managed Prefix List:
#    - The 'cloudfront' mode relies on the "com.amazonaws.global.cloudfront.origin-facing" managed prefix list.
#    - This list is automatically maintained by AWS, guaranteeing that the rules are always up-to-date with the
#      latest CloudFront IP ranges without any manual intervention.
#
# 4. Egress Architecture (Principle of Least Privilege):
#    - The egress rule strictly limits outbound traffic from the ALB exclusively to the security group of the
#      backend Auto Scaling Group (ASG) on the application's listening port (e.g., port 80).
#    - This configuration implements the "TLS Termination at the Load Balancer" pattern, which is a standard
#      and highly recommended architecture for web applications. The key benefits are:
#      * Centralized Certificate Management: SSL/TLS certificates are managed solely on the ALB, eliminating
#        the need to deploy and rotate certificates on each individual application server.
#      * Improved Backend Performance: Application servers are offloaded from the computational overhead of
#        TLS encryption/decryption, freeing up CPU cycles for their primary tasks.
#      * Secure by Design: Communication between the ALB and the backend instances occurs within the secure
#        and private environment of the VPC, isolated from public internet traffic.
#
# 5. Defense-in-Depth:
#    - This security group acts as the network-level (L4) defense for the ALB.
#    - It works in tandem with the application-level (L7) AWS WAF, which validates the secret header from
#      CloudFront, to create a robust, multi-layered security posture.
