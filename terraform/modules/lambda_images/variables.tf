# --- Notes --- #
# 1. Architecture: This module creates an SQS-triggered Lambda function. It's designed to be part of a larger
#    S3 -> SQS -> Lambda -> DynamoDB event-driven pipeline.
# 2. IAM: A dedicated IAM role is created in `iam.tf`. It requires permissions to read from the SQS trigger queue,
#    write to the SQS DLQ, get/put objects in S3, and write items to DynamoDB.
# 3. Dependencies: This module is not standalone. It requires ARNs and names for several external resources:
#    - The main SQS queue that acts as the trigger.
#    - The SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for error handling.
#    - The DynamoDB table for storing metadata.
#    - The S3 bucket for reading/writing images.
# 4. Features: Supports Lambda Layers for dependencies and increased Ephemeral Storage for processing large files.
