# --- Step 3: Wait for ACM Certificate Validation --- #

# --- Step 4: Create ALIAS Records Pointing to CloudFront --- #
# This resource creates the final A-records (as ALIAS) that point your custom domain
# and its subdomains directly to the CloudFront distribution.
# It depends on the successful completion of the ACM certificate validation.

}

# --- Notes --- #
# 1. Execution Order: This module follows a strict, four-step logical sequence.
#    a. A Route 53 zone is created for the domain.
#    b. DNS records for ACM validation are created within that zone.
#    c. The `aws_acm_certificate_validation` resource waits until the certificate is issued.
#    d. Only after successful validation are the final ALIAS records created to point to CloudFront.
#
# 2. ACM Validation Resource:
#    - As per our architectural decision, the `aws_acm_certificate_validation` resource resides here.
#    - This cleanly resolves the dependency chain without creating a cycle, as this module naturally
#      sits between 'acm' and the final desired state.
#
# 3. ALIAS Records vs. CNAME:
#    - We use ALIAS records ('type = "A"' with an 'alias' block) to point to CloudFront.
#    - This is the AWS-recommended best practice. It works for the root domain (apex) and is more
#      efficient than a CNAME record.
#
# 4. Dependency Management:
#    - An explicit `depends_on` is added to the final ALIAS records. While Terraform might infer this
#      dependency, making it explicit ensures the sequence is always respected and improves code clarity.
#
# 5. Usage and Integration Guide:
#    a. Connection Flow:
#       - Pass the 'domain_validation_options' and 'acm_arn' outputs from the ACM module as inputs to this module.
#       - Pass the 'cloudfront_distribution_domain_name' and 'cloudfront_distribution_hosted_zone_id' outputs
#         from the CloudFront module as inputs here.
#
#    b. CRITICAL ACTION after `terraform apply`:
#       - The `custom_zone_name_servers` output contains a list of 4 AWS name servers.
#       - You MUST log into your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap) and update the
#         NS records for your domain to these values. This delegates DNS control to AWS.
#       - DNS propagation can take from a few minutes to 24 hours.
#
#    c. Full Automation:
#       - With correct values passed from other modules, the entire flow (certificate request,
#         DNS validation, and CloudFront aliasing) is fully automated by Terraform.
