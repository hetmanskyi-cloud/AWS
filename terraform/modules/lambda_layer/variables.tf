# --- Notes --- #
# 1. Purpose: This module automates the creation of a Lambda Layer from a Python requirements template file.
# 2. Reusability: Variable names are generic ('layer_name', 'library_version') to allow this module to be used for any Python dependency.
# 3. Dependencies: The machine running 'terraform apply' must have Python, pip, and the 'zip' utility installed.
