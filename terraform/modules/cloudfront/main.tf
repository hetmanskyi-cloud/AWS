# --- Notes --- #
# 1. This CloudFront distribution is multi-origin: it serves both dynamic application content from an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
#    and static media files from a private S3 bucket.
#    - The ALB origin delivers WordPress application traffic and is protected by a custom header (enforced by ALB WAF) to prevent direct access.
#    - The S3 origin is locked down and accessible only through CloudFront via Origin Access Control (OAC).
# 2. All CloudFront-related resources (distributions, OACs, cache policies, and associated WAF/Firehose/CloudWatch Log Delivery
#    components) must be provisioned in the us-east-1 region using the 'aws.cloudfront' provider alias.
#    This is a global AWS service requirement, irrespective of your primary AWS region.
# 3. For development and staging environments, the default AWS-managed SSL certificate and CloudFront domain are utilized.
#    For production deployments, it is strongly advised to provision a custom domain name and an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
#    certificate in us-east-1, integrated with Route53 alias records for a custom endpoint.
# 4. Modern Protocol Support: The distribution is configured with 'http_version = "http2and3"', enabling the latest HTTP/3 protocol
#    for clients that support it, while maintaining backward compatibility with HTTP/2 for optimal performance and reduced latency.
# 5. Cache and Headers Strategy:
#    - Application origin (ALB): Uses the AWS-managed "CachingDisabled" policy, which forwards all headers, cookies, and query strings,
#      and disables caching to ensure real-time application behavior. Caching for dynamic content is delegated to the origin application.
#    - Media origin (S3): Uses a custom optimized policy that excludes cookies and query strings, enables Brotli/GZIP compression,
#      and sets long TTLs for maximum performance.
#    - Security Headers: This distribution uses AWS-managed Response Headers Policies (e.g., "Managed-SecurityHeadersPolicy") attached
#      directly to the cache behaviors. This is a best practice for providing strong, maintenance-free security headers.
# 6. Content-Security-Policy (CSP) Enhancement:
#    - For maximum security against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, a real-world production site should implement a strict
#      Content-Security-Policy (CSP). The AWS-managed policy used here does NOT include CSP, as it must be custom-tailored
#      to the specific application, its themes, and plugins.
#    - Implementing a CSP would require creating a CloudFront Function and replacing the 'response_headers_policy_id' with a
#      'function_association' block in the cache behaviors, after careful testing in a staging environment.
# 7. Origin Protocol Security: The ALB origin uses 'origin_protocol_policy = "http-only"'. This is a deliberate and secure architectural
#    choice. CloudFront terminates the viewer's HTTPS connection, and communication to the origin occurs within the secure AWS backbone.
#    The authenticity of requests is guaranteed by the 'x-custom-origin-verify' secret header, which is validated by a WAF rule
#    on the ALB. An alternative 'https-only' policy can be used for end-to-end encryption if required by specific compliance standards.
# 8. Only safe HTTP methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) are permitted for static content, and all HTTP traffic is automatically
#    redirected to HTTPS, enforcing secure communication channels.
#    For dynamic/application content, all necessary HTTP methods are allowed (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE).
# 9. CloudFront **Access Logging v2** is implemented through AWS CloudWatch Log Delivery services, configured within the
#    'cloudfront/logging.tf' file. This approach offers enhanced flexibility and robust analytics capabilities.
# 10. Integration with AWS WAF for Layer 7 protection is optional and managed within the 'waf.tf' file.
#     All CloudFront WAF resources must specify 'scope = "CLOUDFRONT"' and be provisioned via the 'aws.cloudfront' provider.
# 11. Optional Origin Shield: The module includes a configurable option to enable Origin Shield ('var.enable_origin_shield').
#     This feature adds an extra caching layer to further reduce origin load and is recommended for high-traffic, global applications.
