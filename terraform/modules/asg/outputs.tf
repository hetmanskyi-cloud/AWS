# --- Notes --- #
# 1. **ASG Outputs:**
#    - `asg_id` and `asg_name` provide core identifiers for the Auto Scaling Group.
#
# 2. **Instance Details:**
#    - Instance IDs, public IPs, and private IPs are available when `enable_data_source = true`.
#    - Instance IDs can be used for both general management and SSM operations.
#
# 3. **Launch Template:**
#    - `launch_template_id` and version help track instance configurations.
#
# 4. **Security Groups:**
#    - Security group ID enables additional rule management if needed.
#
# 5. **Scaling Policies:**
#    - Policy ARNs are exposed for CloudWatch Alarm integration.
#
# 6. **Best Practices:**
#    - Use private IPs and VPC DNS resolution for internal communication in production.
#    - Avoid relying on public IPs â€” utilize AWS SSM Session Manager for secure access.
#    - Monitor scaling policy triggers through CloudWatch Alarms to verify expected behavior.
#    - Track `launch_template_latest_version` to ensure ASG is always running the expected template version.
