# --- Notes --- #
# 1. **Alarm Logic**:
#    - Each alarm is controlled by individual boolean variables (e.g., `enable_scale_out_alarm`, `enable_high_network_in_alarm`).
#    - All alarms use `treat_missing_data = "notBreaching"` to minimize false positives if no data is reported.
#
# 2. **Scaling Alarms (Simple Policies Only)**:
#    - `scale_out_alarm`: Triggers the `scale_out_policy` when average CPU utilization exceeds the specified threshold.
#    - `scale_in_alarm`: Triggers the `scale_in_policy` when average CPU utilization drops below the specified threshold.
#    - Both alarms depend on `enable_scaling_policies = true` and require explicit connection to simple scaling policies.
#    - Designed for environments where manual scaling control via CloudWatch Alarms is required.
#    - **Note:** These alarms are not connected to `target_tracking_scaling_policy` â€” Target Tracking creates its own internal alarms automatically.
#
# 3. **Health Monitoring**:
#    - `asg_status_check_failed`: Monitors EC2 instance health at the system level using AWS status checks.
#    - Complements ALB health checks by detecting low-level instance issues (e.g., hardware failure, OS issues).
#    - Can be enabled for deeper system visibility.
#
# 4. **Traffic Monitoring**:
#    - `high_network_in`: Detects unusually high incoming network traffic, which may indicate potential DDoS attacks or traffic spikes.
#    - `high_network_out`: Detects unusually high outgoing network traffic, which may indicate data exfiltration or unexpected outbound spikes.
#    - Both alarms use 3 evaluation periods and require 2 breaching datapoints for reliability and reduced false positives.
#
# 5. **SNS Notifications**:
#    - All alarms send notifications to the configured SNS topic (`sns_topic_arn`) on both ALARM and OK state transitions.
#    - Ensures real-time alerting and recovery visibility.
#
# 6. **Scalability and Flexibility**:
#    - The modular design allows for easy addition or removal of specific alarms based on environment or project requirements.
#    - Each alarm is independently controlled, making it suitable for fine-tuning per environment (dev, stage, prod).
#
# 7. **Production Best Practices**:
#    - Enable `scale_out_alarm` and `scale_in_alarm` for predictable scaling.
#    - Always enable `high_network_in` and `high_network_out` alarms in production for traffic anomaly detection.
#    - Monitor alarm triggering patterns and adjust thresholds to match expected load profiles.
#    - Use `treat_missing_data = "notBreaching"` carefully â€” for critical alarms, consider `missing` handling strategy review.
#    - For critical metrics (e.g., instance status checks), consider using `treat_missing_data = "breaching"` instead of `notBreaching` to catch silent failures.
