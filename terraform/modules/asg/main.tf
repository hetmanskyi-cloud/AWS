# --- Notes --- #
# 1. **ASG Logic**:
#    - The Auto Scaling Group (ASG) dynamically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on scaling policies and health checks.

# 2. **Target Group Integration**:
#    - ASG instances are attached to the ALB's Target Group (wordpress_tg_arn) for traffic routing and health monitoring.

# 3. **Health Checks**:
#    - The ASG uses ELB (ALB) health checks to ensure instance availability and application-level responsiveness.

# 4. **Scaling Policies Control**:
#    - **Simple scaling policies** (scale_out_policy, scale_in_policy) are controlled via the `enable_scaling_policies` variable.
#      - scale_out_policy: Adds an instance when CPU utilization exceeds the defined threshold.
#      - scale_in_policy: Removes an instance when CPU utilization drops below the defined threshold.
#      - These rely on manually defined CloudWatch Alarms for triggering.

#    - **Target Tracking Scaling Policy** is controlled separately via the `enable_target_tracking` variable.
#      - Automatically adjusts ASG capacity to maintain the target average CPU utilization (default: 50%).
#      - AWS manages CloudWatch Alarms internally (no manual alarm configuration needed).
#      - When CloudWatch Logs are enabled, each instance can publish logs (user data, Nginx, etc.) to dedicated log groups.

# 5. **Data Source**:
#    - The optional `aws_instances` data source retrieves instance IDs dynamically from the ASG.
#    - Useful for monitoring dashboards, scripts, or integrations.
#    - Controlled via the `enable_data_source` variable to avoid unnecessary overhead when unused.

# 6. **Launch Template Handling and Rolling Updates**:
#    - The ASG uses a Launch Template for instance configuration, with `version = aws_launch_template.latest_version`.
#    - This ensures Terraform detects version changes and triggers `instance_refresh` automatically.
#    - Safer and more predictable than using the raw string "$Latest", which bypasses Terraformâ€™s change detection.
#    - The `instance_refresh` block ensures rolling replacement of EC2 instances when the Launch Template changes.
#      - This guarantees zero downtime and avoids the need for manual instance termination.
#    - The `lifecycle { create_before_destroy = true }` block further ensures that updates happen without disruption.

# 7. **Security and Best Practices**:
#    - Always use IAM roles with least privilege.
#    - Monitor scaling behavior during load tests to validate auto scaling policy responses.
#    - Avoid using `"$Latest"` for Launch Templates in production to prevent untracked updates.
#    - Prefer `latest_version` (tracked by Terraform) for safe and visible rollouts in dev/staging environments.
#    - Use Terraform outputs and monitoring to observe instance refreshes and scaling actions.
#    - Ensure that the `health_check_grace_period` aligns with application startup times to avoid premature health checks.
