# --- IAM Role for KMS Key Management --- #

# allowing the removal of root access by replacing it with a dedicated IAM role.
# Use this role only for secure manual key administration,
# not for automated or operational workflows â€”
# services should use dedicated IAM policies or KMS grants defined in their own modules.

# --- Notes --- #
# 1. **Purpose**: This IAM role is designed to securely manage the KMS key,
#    replacing the use of root account permissions for ongoing maintenance.
#
# 2. **Enabling the Role**:
#    - Set `enable_kms_admin_role = true` in terraform.tfvars to create this role and policy.
#    - Recommended after initial setup.
#
# 3. **Root Access Management**:
#    - Root access is controlled via the `kms_root_access` variable (in main.tf).
#    - Set `kms_root_access = true` during initial setup.
#    - Set `enable_kms_admin_role = true`. Must be set to true before disabling root access (kms_root_access = false).
#    - After verifying IAM role functionality, set `kms_root_access = false` to remove root permissions from the policy.
#    - WARNING: If the IAM role does not include `kms:PutKeyPolicy`, and root access is disabled,
#      you may permanently lose the ability to update or recover the key policy.
#      Always ensure the admin role includes this action before removing root access.
#
# 4. **Least Privilege**:
#    - This role provides only essential management permissions (describe, rotation, and update).
#    - Avoid granting overly broad permissions (e.g., `kms:*`) unless explicitly required.
#
# 5. **Modular Separation**:
#    - Service-level KMS access (e.g., S3, ASG, RDS) is configured within their respective modules.
#    - This maintains clean separation of concerns and reduces permission sprawl.
#
# 6. **Production Security**:
#    - In production, audit the permissions in `kms_management_policy` regularly.
#    - Tighten access as needed to enforce your organization's security posture.
