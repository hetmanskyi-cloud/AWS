# --- Notes --- #
# - Includes alarms for DecryptCount (high usage) and AccessDenied (unauthorized attempts).
# - 'threshold', 'evaluation_periods', and 'datapoints_to_alarm' are tuned to reduce false positives.
# - SNS notifications are enabled via 'sns_topic_arn' (set in terraform.tfvars).
# - If 'sns_topic_arn' is empty, alarms will trigger silently (no email or alert).
