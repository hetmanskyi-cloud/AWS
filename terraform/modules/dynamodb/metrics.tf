# --- Notes --- #
# 1. Throttling vs. System Errors:
#    - The `ThrottledRequests` alarm is the most critical for performance tuning. It's the
#      primary indicator that you need to adjust Provisioned Throughput or check your
#      On-Demand capacity settings.
#    - The `SystemErrors` alarm is for service health. It's rare but essential for
#      detecting underlying issues with the DynamoDB service.
#
# 2. Granularity: The throttling alarm is configured to monitor only `PutItem`
#    operations, as this is the primary write action performed by the Lambda function.
#    This provides more specific and actionable alerts.
#
# 3. Conditional Creation: Alarms are only created if the `cloudwatch_alarms_topic_arn`
#    variable is provided, keeping the monitoring feature optional and modular.
